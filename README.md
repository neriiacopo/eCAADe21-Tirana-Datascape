This repository is produced within the eCAADe Ris 2020 (October 2021) regional summit - Tirana Datascapes workshop - held by [Eugenio Bettucchi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugenio-bettucchi-b59683b5), [Erzë Dinarama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erz%C3%AB-dinarama-20532558/), and [Iacopo Neri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iacopo-neri-25a375132/).
We would like to thank Edi Duro for the invaluable support during the set up phase of the workshop.

## Requirements
- [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/) (ideally 7)
- [Urbano add-on](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/urbano) (v1.3.3)

## About the workshop
The workshop will explore data storytelling for different aspects of Tirana’s urbanscape, and how those stories can be represented through computational drawings and physical models. The drawings and models are used as tools for thinking, speculating, investigating, and discovery. This art and science exercise, aims at creating a set of computational cartographic representations and models that are based on geospatial data and critical thinking.
The team of tutors will gather georeferenced data beforehand, for different aspects of the city of Tirana; from infrastructure, public space, landscape, to ecological data.
